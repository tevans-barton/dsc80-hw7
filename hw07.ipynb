    "## Instructions\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the homework problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding work will be developed in an accompanying `hw0X.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. (`X` is a homework number)\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook will be graded (for graphs and free response questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. The dictionary at the end of the file (`GRADED FUNCTIONS`) contains the \"grading list\". The final function in the file allows your doctests to check that all the necessary functions exist.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present you the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *HW assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for PAs will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional functions to solve the HW! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `hw0X.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",
    "- Always document your code!"

    "**Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "You realized that you have a lot of free time and you decided to learn a new language. Since you are not sure which language to choose, you decided to check out the News API: `https://newsapi.org/`. The NewsAPI allows you to make requests to a URL and get a response based on the parameters and values you request. In order to send requests you must click on the `Get API Key` button and fill out the form to access a key. Save this key; you need it to access the API. You will have it saved in your account as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'd suggest you explore the site (especially `Get started page`). Once you have an idea what is required to send requests, you are ready to test things out. Since you need to decide what language to learn, you decided to compare the number of articles in different languages: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `send_requests` that takes an `apiKey` as a parameter, and a variable number of arguments that represent languages for your requests. (use \\*args to represent a variable number of arguments. <a href= \": https://pythontips.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/\">Link for help</a>). This function should return a list of dictionaries, where each key-value pair is a languages parameter and the corresponding Response object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, after calling `output = send_requests('625f44103f1c4fdca96844baefad03f5',\"ru\", \"fr\") ` the *output* is ```[{'ru': <Response [200]>}, {'fr': <Response [200]>}]```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a function `gather_info` that takes a list like `outputs` and returns a list with:\n",
    "* language that has the most number of articles (based on \"Total Results\")\n",
    "* Each article was taken from a certain source (url). You need to find the most popular base url (without http) for each language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For languages `ru` and `fr` the output was `['fr', 'lenta.ru', 'www.lequipe.fr']`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You only can send requests in one function. One request per language. \n",
    "2. Do not compare your results with the given outputs. The news is updated often.\n",
    "3. You must have at least two helper methods. \n",
    "4. Keep your apikey hidden. This means that you can not use it explicitly in the doctests.  You need to set an environment variable to the value of your unique apikey, which you will get from the newsapi site, and then use os.environ['name of your enviroment variable'] to obtain the value."
